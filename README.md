Hello, This is Ruben and this is my project.
I hope you like this.

# CrossRoadsTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.
And as a backend ts-node version 8.6.2, typescript version 3.7.4.

## Running backend server

Backend server is located in 'Server' directory, please navigate to the server directory and run 'yarn serve'. 
Navigate to 'http://localhost:4201/'. The backend api will be working.

## Running frontend server

Run 'ng serve' or 'yarn serve' for a frontend angular server.
Run `ng serve` or 'yarn serve' for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If there is a problem, please let me know.
It's working well, on my pc.
